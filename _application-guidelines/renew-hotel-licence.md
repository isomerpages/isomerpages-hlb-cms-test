### **Application to Renew Hotel Licence**

The Hotel licence to operate a hotel will expire on 31 December every year, regardless of the date of licence issuance. A Certificate of Registration and Hotel-Keeper's licence are required under the Hotels Act to operate a hotel.

Applications for the renewal of the Certificate of Registration and Hotel-Keeper's licence can only be made in the last quarter of the calendar year. Licensees will be notified by post and email on the renewal application process and requirements.

> Note:
> * Your hotel must have a valid Grant of Written Permission (WP), which expires no earlier than 1 January of the following year.
> * Should there be a change of Hotel-Keeper, change of Hotel Name or hotel details in the renewal application, these changes will only take effect 1 January of the following year.
> * If the changes are to be effected for the current year, please see the requirements as stated under the [Change of Hotel-Keeper](https://isomerpages-hlb.netlify.com/application-guidelines/change-of-hotel-keeper/) or [Change of Hotel-Name](https://isomerpages-hlb.netlify.com/application-guidelines/change-of-hotel-name/).
